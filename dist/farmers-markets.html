          Coming soon on our website we will feature farmers markets which are a
          gathering of local farmers, growers, and artisans who come together to
          sell their produce and handmade goods directly to consumers.
          <br />

          Organicnearby is an online platform that connects consumers with
          farmers and vendors who sell fresh, local and organic products. It
          allows you to browse and shop for fresh, locally sourced food from the
          comfort of your own home.
          <br />
          <br />
          You can also use OrganicNearby to pre-order items from vendors at a
          farmers market and pick them up on market day.This allows you to skip
          the sometimes-long lines at the market and ensures that the products
          you want are available for you to purchase.
