          We also have partnerships with reputable organizations, businesses,
          and websites that share our mission of promoting fresh, local, and
          organic food. Our partnership with the University of Idaho
          Agricultural Extension Service demonstrates our commitment to working
          with reputable organizations to provide accurate and helpful
          information to farmers.

          team of students from Sacramento State University Department of
          Information Systems and Business Analytics who are committed to the
